Default simulation parameters

Spatial difference operator level:

  0: Auto pick 2 or 6
  1: Mesh with constant spacing dx
  2: Rectangular mesh
  3: Parallelepiped mesh
  4: One-point quadrature
  5: Exactly integrated elements
  6: Saved operators, nearly as fast as 2, but doubles the memory usage
